## Abstract  
Avalanches, landslides, and debris flows are geophysical hazards, which involve rapid mass movement
of granular solids, water, and air as a single phase system. In order to describe the mechanism of
immersed granular flows, it is important to consider both the dynamics of the solid phase and the
role of the ambient fluid (Denlinger and Iverson, 2001). The dynamics of the solid phase alone are
insufficient to describe the mechanism of granular flows in fluid. It is important to consider the
effect of hydrodynamic forces that reduce the weight of the solids inducing a transition from
dense-compacted to dense-suspended flows, and the drag interactions which counteract the movement
of the solids (Meruane et al., 2010). Transient regimes characterised by a change in the solid
fraction, dilation at the onset of flow and the development of excess pore-pressure, result in
altering the balance between the stress carried by the fluid and that carried by the grains, thereby
changing the overall behaviour of the flow. In the present study, a two-dimensional coupled Lattice
Boltzmann LBM â€“ DEM technique is developed to understand the micro-scale rheology of granular
flows in fluid.

In the present study, the collapse of a granular column in fluid is studied using 2D LBM - DEM.
The effect of initial aspect ratio on the run-out behaviour is investigated. The flow kinematics are
compared with the dry and buoyant granular collapse to understand the influence of hydrodynamic forces
and lubrication on the run-out. In the case of tall columns, the amount of material destabilised above
the failure plane is larger than that of short columns. Hence in tall columns, the surface area of the
mobilised mass that interacts with the surrounding fluid is significantly higher than the short columns.
This increase in the area of soil - fluid interaction results in an increase in the formation of
turbulent vortices that alter the deposit morphology during the collapse. It is observed that the
vortices result in formation of heaps that significantly affect the distribution of mass in the flow.
Staron and Hinch (2007) observed that the distribution of mass in a granular flow plays a crucial role
in the flow kinematics. In order to understand the behaviour of tall columns, the run-out behaviour of a
dense granular column with an initial aspect ratio of 6 is studied. The collapse of a tall granular
column on slopes of 0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 are studied. The permeability of the granular mass was varied
to understand the effect of permeability on the run-out behaviour.
